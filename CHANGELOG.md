### In this release
- Android shell crate: NativeActivity entry point, preferences under the app's own data directory,
  file logger, single-window lifecycle.
- In-app file picker drawn with egui, with readable-root probing, "Show all files", hidden-file
  count, and a locked root that names the permission it needs.
- Edge-to-edge fix for `targetSdkVersion 35` (`res/values/styles.xml`, variant B immersive).
- **File ▸ Exit** now really ends the process (it previously appeared to hang on a stale close).
- **Ctrl / Shift / Alt** work: the platform reports no modifiers, so they are tracked from key events
  and re-injected (5 host unit tests, all passing).
- **System fonts** (`/system/fonts` and friends) plus a USB-visible *Fonts* folder a user can drop a
  `.ttf` into.
- HEIC/HEIF opening enabled by default (as the official builds compile it).
- App icon (adaptive) and launcher label; `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` + media permissions declared.
